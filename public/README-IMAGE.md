# Dashboard Screenshot Instructions

To add the dashboard preview image to your README:

1. **Take a screenshot of your dashboard:**
   - Start the dev server: `pnpm dev`
   - Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser
   - Take a full-page screenshot showing:
     - Agent flowchart
     - Metrics cards
     - Timeline view
     - Chat interface (if visible)

2. **Save the screenshot:**
   - Save as: `dashboard-preview.png`
   - Location: `public/dashboard-preview.png`
   - Recommended dimensions: 1920x1080 or similar

3. **The image is already referenced in README.md:**
   - Line 7: `![ThermoTrace Dashboard](./public/dashboard-preview.png)`
   - Line 131: `![Dashboard Screenshot](./public/dashboard-preview.png)`

4. **Alternative:** If you prefer a different format or name:
   - Save your image to `public/` folder
   - Update the paths in README.md accordingly

## Quick Screenshot Tips:

- Use a clean browser window (hide bookmarks bar)
- Make sure the dashboard is fully loaded
- Include the key features in view
- Use tools like:
  - Windows: `Win + Shift + S` for Snipping Tool
  - Full page screenshot extensions in Chrome/Edge
  - ShareX for advanced screenshots

Once you add the image, the README will display it automatically!
